## 🔄 Workflow

![Emergency Workflow](docs/emergency-workflow.png)

**Streamlined Process:**
1. **Emergency Initiation** - Patient calls hospital/services
2. **Hospital Response** - Verifies & assigns nearest ambulance
3. **Route Calculation** - AI optimizes considering traffic
4. **Green Corridor** - Automatic traffic signal priority
5. **Live Tracking** - Real-time updates to all parties

- Signals turn green in sequence as ambulance approaches
- Real-time coordination with traffic management systems

### Phase 4: Live Tracking & Updates
- Continuous GPS tracking of ambulance location
- Real-time ETA updates sent to hospital
- Patient/family notifications with progress updates
- Route adjustments based on changing conditions

### Phase 5: Completion & Reset
- System confirms ambulance arrival at hospital
- Traffic signals return to normal operation
- Emergency token marked as completed
- Performance metrics logged for analysis

## 🚀 Scalability & Fault Tolerance

MediRoute AI is designed as a **cloud‑native, city‑grade emergency mobility platform** that can safely grow across cities while avoiding system failures.

---

### 📈 Handling Growth (Scalability)

#### 1️⃣ City‑Wise Logical Isolation
Each city runs as an independent logical unit:
- Separate hospitals, ambulances, and traffic grids  
- New cities can be added without affecting existing deployments

---

#### 2️⃣ Realtime Database Scaling (Supabase)
- Handles thousands of concurrent GPS streams  
- Sub‑second realtime updates  
- Automatic indexing and partitioning  

Supports **1000+ ambulances streaming every 2 seconds**.

---

#### 3️⃣ Stateless Core Services
MediRoute Core services are stateless:
- Any request can go to any server instance  
- Vercel auto‑scales horizontally  
- No single server becomes a bottleneck

---

#### 4️⃣ Modular Micro‑Service Design

| Module | Independent Scaling |
|-------|---------------------|
| Route Engine | Yes |
| Hospital Allocation AI | Yes |
| Traffic Signal Controller | Yes |
| MediBot AI Nurse | Yes |

Each heavy module scales independently based on load.

---

### 🛡️ Avoiding Failures (Fault Tolerance)

#### 1️⃣ No Single Point of Failure
- All emergency state stored in Supabase  
- If one server crashes, another instantly takes over

---

#### 2️⃣ Live Health Monitoring
The system monitors:
- Ambulance GPS heartbeat  
- Traffic signal responses  
- Hospital availability  

Auto‑recovery is triggered if any component fails.

---

#### 3️⃣ Safe Fallback Modes

| Failure Scenario | Automatic System Action |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| Traffic API down | Route recalculated using normal roads |
| Hospital overloaded | Next best hospital auto‑assigned |
| GPS signal lost | Last known location used + driver alert |
| Network outage | Manual mode enabled |

---

#### 4️⃣ Human Override Layer
Admins can:
- Pause green corridors  
- Manually assign hospitals  
- Disable faulty traffic signals  

This ensures a human safety layer above AI.

---

#### 5️⃣ Data Durability & Recovery
- Automatic backups & replication  
- Emergency states auto‑restored  
- Zero data loss guarantee

> **MediRoute AI uses cloud auto‑scaling, realtime replication, stateless services, and human override layers to ensure zero downtime emergency operations across cities.**
